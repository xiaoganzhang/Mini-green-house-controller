# Mini-green-house-controller

Abstract

Our project is an energy-efficient mini greenhouse that smartly controls environmental conditions such as temperature, CO2 levels, and humidity. We utilize a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B as the central control unit. An attached camera module is used with artificial intelligence to detect plant growth status. We develop an android application to illustrate data from sensors and display AI-generated plant growth suggestions. All of the specifications from our COVID-19 scope update are met. Our achievements including: system controlling the hardware inside of the greenhouse, using camera module to synchronize pictures to the computer for processing, sending the received pictures into neural networks to classify the state of growth of mushrooms, and building an App on smartphones to monitor the growth of mushrooms, temperature, humidity, lighting, and CO2 concentration



Mini green house controller
This app is a java-basaed android app developed using Android studio.
There will be a login section and three main pages. One for the information and controlling, one for the picture of the mushroom and one for the connection between the Raspberyy Pi.
Using Socket communication and will have to connect to the HotSpot via WIFI.
